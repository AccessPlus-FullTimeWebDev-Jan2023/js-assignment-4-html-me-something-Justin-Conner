      <p>      When I was in third grade I "discovered" a cool new type of Origami.  If you look on the internet you can find 
      it by typing into Google "jeff benyon spiral" yes I put his name in lower case. If you would like to see an 
      example of what it looks like as created by me, the original "discoverer" follow this link.

               I am a firm believer that there isn't really any true invention.  I believe that all things that are to be or could be,
         have and do exist independant of those who claim to have "invented" them. There is really only the concept that some 
         are the first to publish or make known that they have made the "invention".

           Aside from that quirky little tid bit I like to be goofy and make videos when I am having a few brewskis. If you want to see some 
     of my comedic escapades it is as simple as follwing this link <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/161TZCzG3IUBewsknDx3Ox_
     4vA3XRQJa6/view?usp=sharing">My fridge is cool, Literally</a> Some might say that is "childish".  Well if that is your opinion you 
     will be happy to know that I was a child actor as well, in the Movie <u>HOME ALONE</u> it's just as easy as following this link.

     <p>      I know what you are thinking...This dude writes programs, drinks beers, was a child actor, is setting up his own server and
       is super nice? What is it that this guy doesn't do? Well I can tell you one more thing I do do (lol he said doo doo).  
       I love to make graphic art as well as draw and paint.  you can find my most recent little diddy by following this link. 
       <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lqvKfzPFUr9TOJXsbkr9tcdddfDBFxtY/view?usp=sharing">Art Game Homie</a>In case you were curious
       yes I dropped the dirty little beat in the background too.

               So if you read all this without clicking on my portfolio link at the top first, that takes you to my GitHub, that takes you to 
         where you will find my "Fun Factos" (located in my GitHub READEME.md file that also has a cool profile visitor tracker written in 
         markdown), then I guess you took the long route. aint nothin' wrong with that Jack!

   <p>I am having a great time exploring how to get my Kemp Load Balancer 
      set up to distribute the network traffic for my home server to the different support servers: <br>softether VPN
      <br> Redis (supports different kinds of abstract data structures)<br>MySql Database<br>lightpd webserver<br>
      MindsDB (Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence)<br>Voip / PBX (phone over internet) <br>TsPlus (remote desktop)
      <br> All to host my website for the final project if I do infact accomplish all this. I sure hope to.</p>
